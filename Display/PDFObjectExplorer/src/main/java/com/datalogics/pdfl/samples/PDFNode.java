 * =============================== PDF NODE ===================================
 * The PDFNode object extends the DefaultMutableTreeNode.  It extends the basic
 * node class by associating a TreeNode with a PDFObject in the document.
 *
 * As the user explores the document by clicking on items in the tree, we
 * dynamically add nodes to the tree, associating each node with a newly
 * discovered PDFObject.  In this way, the structure of the tree mirrors
 * the structure of the document--i.e. the relationship of dictionaries
 * containing other dictionaries and arrays and such--in a very direct manner.
 *
 * The alternative is to maintain a separate database of the document structure
 * that contains all the PDFObjects and keep that database in sync with the
 * TreeModel.
 *
 * Note that one side effect of this design is that we do not detect loops in
 * the document structure: if a dictionary contains a pointer to its own parent,
 * our user tree will have branches that never terminate (i.e. reach a node
 * that only holds scalar objects.)  However, since the node exploration process
 * never searches more than two nodes deep, the code never enters an
 * 'infinite loop'--node exploration is entirely under user control.
 *
 * These nodes are created using the EnumObjectsForTree class.
 *
 * Additional notes:
 *
 * - Nodes are created passing in the string value of pdfObject and is assigned
 *   to 'userObject'.  'userObject' is the text that is displayed on screen.
 *
 * - the PDFObjects are returned to the main class through getPDFObject()
